## Project Overview

The **Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard** is a dynamic, interactive Power BI tool that visualizes key metrics related to loan applications, funding, and repayments. It helps stakeholders monitor loan performance, assess risks, and identify borrower trends for better decision-making.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Loan Applications**: 38,600  
- **Total Funded Amount**: $435.8M  
- **Total Amount Received**: $473.1M  
- **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI)**: 13.3%  
- **Average Interest Rate**: 12.0%

### **Borrower Demographics and Trends**  
- **Purpose of Loans**:  
The majority (18.2%) of loans are for **debt consolidation**, followed by credit card refinancing and small business needs.  

- **Employment Length**:  
Borrowers with **10+ years of experience** are the largest group, applying for 8,300 loans.  

- **Home Ownership**:

### Challenges  
Loan applications have declined steadily month-over-month, from 4,300 in December to 2,300 in February. This downward trend calls for deeper analysis to understand seasonal patterns or other contributing factors.

## Regional Insights  
The dashboard also includes a geographical breakdown, visualizing loan applications by state and identifying high-activity regions.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned  
This project highlights the importance of:
- **Risk Management**: Despite high performance, bad loans still account for $65.5M funded.
